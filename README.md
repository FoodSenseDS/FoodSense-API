# FoodSense API

## Introduction
The FoodSense API is the backbone of a sophisticated food delivery system designed to streamline and enhance the food ordering and delivery experience. Operating on the Azure platform, specifically utilizing Azure Spring Apps, this API serves as the communication bridge between various components within the food delivery ecosystem.
